# FollowBone3D

Simple plugin to allow for nodes to follow the transformation of bones within a 3d Skeleton. Very useful for attaching colliders to areas/bones of your meshes when there are animations changing the position of the bones. Its not super efficient, but does the job. PRs welcome!

## Install

Clone/download this repo into your project and activate the plugin from the project settings. You will have a new node called FollowBone3D.

## Example

See the example folder. It has a zombie with two collision shapes attached to two different bones.
Also, see the video below (when I make it).

## Attribution

The example uses a zombie model by Thomas.Osterhammel from [https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/zombie-d22e3dc957b142479e1723a379494eb3](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/zombie-d22e3dc957b142479e1723a379494eb3) and animations from [https://www.mixamo.com/](https://www.mixamo.com/)
